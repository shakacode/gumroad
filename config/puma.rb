# Puma can serve each request in a thread from an internal thread pool.
# The `threads` method setting takes two numbers a minimum and maximum.
# Any libraries that use thread pools should be configured to match
# the maximum value specified for Puma. Default is set to 5 threads for minimum
# and maximum, this matches the default thread size of Active Record.
#
# See unicorn migration guide: https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/master/docs/deployment.md#migrating-from-unicorn

# Specifies the `worker_timeout` threshold that Puma will use to wait before
# terminating a worker in development environments.

worker_timeout 3600 if ENV.fetch("RAILS_ENV", "development") == "development"

# Specifies the `port` that Puma will listen on to receive requests, default is 3000.
#
# Spelled as `bind` rather than `port` only because the backlog has to ride on the query
# string -- the `port` DSL builds a bare tcp:// URI, so it always takes Puma's default
# backlog of 1024. That queue is shared by every worker and drained by workers * threads
# request slots, so a burst of slow requests fills it in seconds; past that the kernel
# drops SYNs and nginx reports a connect timeout. 4096 matches the listen backlog nginx
# uses out front, and somaxconn clamps both to the same ceiling.

  # Specifies the number of `workers` to boot in clustered mode.
  # Workers are forked webserver processes. If using threads and workers together
  # the concurrency of the application would be max `threads` * `workers`.
  # Workers do not work on JRuby or Windows (both of which do not support
  # processes).
  #
  # workers ENV.fetch("WEB_CONCURRENCY") { 2 }
  workers ENV.fetch("PUMA_WORKER_PROCESSES") { 1 }

  # Use the `preload_app!` method when specifying a `workers` number.
  # This directive tells Puma to first boot the application and load code
  # before forking the application. This takes advantage of Copy On Write
  # process behavior so workers use less memory. If you use this option
  # you need to make sure to reconnect any threads in the `on_worker_boot`
  # block.
  #
  preload_app!

  # No `on_worker_boot` reconnect. Rails 7.2 discards every pool after a fork
  # (ActiveSupport::ForkTracker, connection_adapters/pool_config.rb), so the old
  # ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection here was already redundant — and it is
  # now actively harmful: ApplicationRecord.connects_to shares ActiveRecord::Base's
  # pool, so re-establishing hands `connection_class` back to ActiveRecord::Base and
  # mysql2_proxy stops honoring ApplicationRecord.connected_to(role: :writing).
