  # The direct-listed lane deliberately gets NO key. The obvious substitute — external id +
  # currency, as Charge::MethodForcedPresentment.idempotency_key_for uses — is stable across
  # attempts on this lane, because the charge row is found-or-created per seller and no
  # ConfirmationToken scopes it the way Order::PreparePaymentIntentService scopes the
  # method-forced key. Stripe would then replay a declined intent for 24h and the buyer could
  # not retry their card at all. Duplicate intents are recoverable; a locked-out buyer is not.
