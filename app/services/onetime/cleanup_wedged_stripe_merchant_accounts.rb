# Cleans up half-provisioned Stripe merchant accounts that permanently wedge a
# seller's payout onboarding. See issue #487.
#
# StripeMerchantAccountManager.create_account is non-atomic: between
# Stripe::Account.create (which saves charge_processor_merchant_id) and the line
# that sets charge_processor_alive_at, a non-Stripe interruption (deploy, DB blip,
# timeout) used to escape the rescue — which only caught Stripe::StripeError — and
# leave a MerchantAccount with a merchant id, no charge_processor_alive_at, and no
# charge_processor_deleted_at. The self-serve form guard
# (merchant_accounts.stripe.alive.empty?) then sees that row and never lets the
# seller retry, so payouts skip forever with "the payout bank account was not
# correctly set up".
#
# The forward fix broadens that rescue so new failures clean up after themselves.
# This task remediates the rows stranded before that shipped: for each wedged row
# whose owner has no other alive Stripe account it runs the same cleanup the
# forward fix uses — StripeMerchantAccountManager.cleanup_failed_merchant_account —
# which deletes the orphaned half-provisioned Stripe account and soft-deletes the
# row, so the seller can onboard again from scratch via the normal flow.
#
# It does NOT re-provision accounts or move money. Owners with a stranded balance
# are logged so support can prompt them to re-enter their payout details.
