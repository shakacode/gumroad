# Detects email blasts that were requested and never finished sending (gumroad-private#1750) and,
# behind :auto_resume_stalled_post_blasts, resumes the safe ones itself (gumroad-private#2106).
#
# A stranded blast keeps `completed_at` nil forever — retries exhaust into the dead set, or the
# enqueue never reached Redis — while the seller's dashboard shows a plausible non-zero delivered
# count, so the only detection channel was a seller who knew their own audience size writing in.
# 11 blasts / ~1.6M undelivered emails accrued that way over ten days before anyone noticed.
# (A hard-killed job itself is not the stranding mode: super_fetch resurrects it.)
#
# Auto-resume is deliberately conservative: only DEAD/UNACCOUNTED blasts still inside
# AUTO_RESUME_WINDOW, at most once per blast, and never a non-opener resend while UNACCOUNTED —
# its dedupe set is written only after delivery, so a duplicate racing a live sender the
# snapshots missed would double-deliver. Older blasts may be time-boxed sale announcements worse
# delivered late than not at all, and a blast that stalls AGAIN after a resume has something
# wrong this job cannot see — all of these stay a human call and are reported as HELD.
