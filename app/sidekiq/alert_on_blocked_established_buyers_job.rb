# Reports buyers with real payment history who are currently stranded behind a platform block their
# checkouts keep failing against (gumroad-private#1640).
#
# AlertOnBlockedEstablishedSubscribersJob covers the same staleness on RENEWALS. It cannot see the
# buyer this job exists for: it selects subscriptions, and a stranded buyer's failing purchase is
# usually an ordinary one-off checkout. Measured over 7 days of these failures, 76% of the clean
# history buyers behind them had no recurring charge the subscriber report could have keyed on.
#
# The scan itself lives in Risk::StrandedBuyerScanService, shared with the admin API so the alert
# and the CLI cannot disagree about who is stranded. Reports; clearing goes through
# Risk::StrandedBuyerRecoveryService or a human.
