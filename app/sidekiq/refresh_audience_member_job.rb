# Converges one buyer's audience_members row out of band. Purchase changes schedule this
# instead of writing the projection inline (see Purchase::AudienceMember); follower and
# affiliate callbacks fall back to it when their incremental update hits a LockWaitTimeout.
# refresh! rebuilds from live purchase/follower/affiliate state, so running it once the
# contending writers finish is correct regardless of which update lost.
#
# lock: :until_executing (not :until_executed) so a purchase that commits while a refresh
# is already running can enqueue a follow-up. :until_executed + on_conflict: :replace
# dropped that follow-up and left the projection stale. refresh! uses with_lock so
# the row lock holds through the source reads and save.
