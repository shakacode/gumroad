    # The saved-cart twin of buyer_can_name_price? below. A cart line records the tier the buyer

    # is the SELECTED tier, not whether the membership happens to offer a pay-what-you-want tier
    # somewhere. `Link#has_customizable_price_option?` answers the latter — it scans every alive
    # tier — so a cart line on a free non-pay-what-you-want tier of a membership that also sells a
    # pay-what-you-want tier reported a customizable price, suppressed the "not_charged"
    # classification, and mounted the Payment Element on a checkout that charges nothing.
    #
    # Only a TIERED MEMBERSHIP's option carries the flag. `Variant::Prices#set_customizable_price`
    # returns early for anything else, so an ordinary product's variants always read false even
    # when the product itself is pay-what-you-want — reading the option there would wrongly call a
    # real pay-what-you-want cart free. For a non-membership the product's own
    # `customizable_price` column is authoritative, which is what has_customizable_price_option?
    # returns for that case.
    #
    # A membership line with NO tier recorded reads false rather than deferring to the product.
    # Both of the product-level answers available here are wrong for it: the tier scan inside
    # has_customizable_price_option? is the product-wide question this method exists to stop
    # asking (one pay-what-you-want tier would speak for a line that selected none), and the
    # `customizable_price` column is unreliable on memberships — it can be stale-true, which is
    # why buyer_can_name_price? guards it too. On a membership the buyer names a price only
    # through a tier, so with no tier there is no pending amount and the price is known.

    # Whether the buyer can still name their own price for this line, which fallback_reason_for
    # must not read as "free" (see the zero-total comment there).
    #
    # The product-level `pwyw` field is not enough on its own, because it is not tier-aware. For a
    # tiered membership the TIER carries the flag, via `Variant::Prices` — so the tier is what has
    # to be consulted, and the product column must not be trusted. A $0 pay-what-you-want
    # membership opened through /checkout?product=… fell back to CardElement while the same product
    # added from a saved cart did not.
    #
    # Note the product column can be STALE-true on a membership, which is why this reads
    # `is_tiered_membership` before trusting `pwyw` at all. During create,
    # `Product::Prices#write_customizable_price` runs (via `price_range=`) while
    # `is_tiered_membership` is still false, so any membership created with a $0 starting price
    # persists `customizable_price = true`; the `set_customizable_price` after_save callback
    # early-returns for memberships, so nothing ever clears it. `customizable_price` is also a
    # directly writable param on both the web and v2 API update paths. Trusting it here would mount
    # the Payment Element on a genuinely free membership tier — the defect this method's
    # selected-tier check exists to prevent — and would disagree with
    # cart_line_buyer_can_name_price?, which already guards on the membership flag first.
    #
    # The tier-level check has to look at the tier the buyer actually SELECTED, not at every tier
    # the product offers. `options` lists all of them, so asking "does any option allow naming a
    # price" says yes for a membership that merely HAS a pay-what-you-want tier somewhere — which
    # would suppress the "free" classification even when the buyer picked a genuinely free tier
    # with no amount to charge, and mount the Payment Element on a checkout that charges nothing.
    # `option_id` is the selected tier (CheckoutPresenter sets it from the accepted upsell, the
    # cart item, or an upgrading subscription's current tier), so scope the check to that option.
    # A membership with no option_id has no selected tier, and a membership's price can only be
    # named through a tier, so there is no pending amount and the price is known — the same answer
    # cart_line_buyer_can_name_price? gives a cart line with no option.
