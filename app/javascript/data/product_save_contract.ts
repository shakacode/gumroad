// Builds the explicit deletion operations for a save (gumroad-private#1379).
//
// ## Why this exists
//
// The editor save used to be a full snapshot: whatever the payload didn't
// mention was deleted. That made three different things indistinguishable —
// "the seller removed it", "this client didn't load it", and "the field was
// malformed and got dropped" — and the server had to guess which. It guessed
// wrong often enough to empty live products.
//
// Under the contract the server never infers. Removal is stated, or it doesn't
// happen. This function is where the editor states it.
//
// ## Where the ids come from
//
// Not from diffing. The editor already records every removal the seller
// confirms, at the moment they confirm it, in `confirmed_removed_*_ids` — the
// deletion modals push onto those lists. Re-deriving deletions by comparing the
// current state against the loaded state would reintroduce exactly the
// inference this contract removes: a page the client failed to load looks
// identical to a page the seller deleted.
//
// So: the seller's confirmed removals ARE the deletion operations. Anything
// else missing from the payload is, by definition, not a deletion.

// The seller's confirmed removals are the only input this needs. Taking a
// narrow parameter type rather than the whole Product keeps the contract honest
// (nothing else can influence what gets deleted) and lets tests construct real
// inputs instead of casting a stub.
//
// Files, public files and integrations are read from the editor's own removal
// state rather than from a parallel `confirmed_removed_*` list, because that IS
// where those removals are already recorded: a file the seller removed carries
// `status.type === "removed"`, and an integration they unchecked is simply
// false. Introducing a second source of truth for the same fact would let the
// two disagree.

// move_source_ids, whose deletion intent would otherwise vanish with the
// variant. A page that left the variant earlier is deliberately not covered.
// A STORED id a surviving page still carries is skipped: raw ids can repeat
// across scopes, and sending a shared stored id names the survivor's row for
// deletion. A newly added page's client id records even when shared — it is
// inert until reconciliation resolves it through the removed scope's mapping,
