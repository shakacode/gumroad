  # reversed like that, the subscriber no longer holds the upgraded plan's
  # full value, so crediting them the full price would over-credit them and
  # make the next charge too low. In that case fall back to the charge's own
  # holds — so use that instead.
  #
  # A fully refunded or charged-back upgrade still appears in
  # successful_purchases (refunds and chargebacks are tracked on the purchase,
  # they don't change its state), but the subscriber no longer holds the
