  # IOF is a Brazilian consumer tax on any transaction that involves foreign exchange, currently
  # 3.5% of the transaction value. It applies whenever the Pix payment leaves Brazil, which is
  # every Pix charge except one created directly on a Brazilian seller's own Stripe account.
  #
  # This constant is the RECOVERY half, and it is narrower than the tax itself: it is billed only
  # when Gumroad actually bore the cost. On a charge created on a Gumroad-held account, Gumroad
  # tells Stripe to bill the buyer exactly the price they agreed to
  # (`amount_includes_iof=always`, see Order::PreparePaymentIntentService#pix_payment_method_options)
  # and Stripe deducts the IOF from what settles to us — so the cost has to be charged back to the
  # seller as a fee component, or it would silently come out of Gumroad's own margin instead (the
  # decision on gumroad-private#1305 was that the seller absorbs it).
  #
  # On a direct charge to a seller's own connected account the money never passes through a
  # Gumroad-held balance, so there is no Gumroad cost to recover and this fee is not billed —
  # whether or not the tax itself applied. That makes this gate deliberately DIFFERENT from
  # Order::PreparePaymentIntentService#pix_iof_applies?, which decides whether the tax exists at
  # all (a border question, keyed on the account's country) rather than who paid it. See the
  # comment on that method.
