  # webhook and the stale-checkout abandonment worker. We delete the rows outright
  # rather than marking them voided: neither table has a state column, and adding one
  # would require a migration for data nobody reads — receipts, refunds, and accounting
  # only consult presentment rows on charges that actually settled, and a retried
  # checkout builds a brand-new charge whose intent-prepare step persists a fresh
  # snapshot. Deleting therefore also guarantees at most one live presentment set per
  # checkout attempt. Idempotent: re-delivered webhooks find nothing left to delete.
