  # The purchase whose receipt and invoice this one's buyer should be shown. Usually itself, but
  # the row a buyer reaches through their library is not always the row that holds the money:
  #
  # - bundle content: this is the $0 per-product access record the bundle created, and the money
  #   was paid on the bundle purchase;
  # - membership: `Purchase.for_library` excludes recurring charges, so this is the sign-up —
  #   potentially years and several cards before the period the buyer wants invoiced.
  #
  # The GIFTER's purchase is rejected as a candidate rather than the giftee's row being excluded
  # from the subscription branch: it shares a subscription with the giftee's row, so resolving to
  # it would serve the giftee the gifter's email, amount, and card. Once the giftee adds a card
  # and the membership renews, those renewals carry the giftee's own email (`Subscription#email`
  # via `#build_purchase`), and excluding the giftee's row wholesale would have pinned them to the
  # original $0 gift forever.
  #
  # Resolving away from `self` requires the two rows to agree on the email exactly, because the
  # email is the only thing the receipt and invoice endpoints check. A membership reassigned by
  # editing the sign-up's email leaves earlier charges on the previous holder's address, so
  # without this guard the new holder would be handed a working link to someone else's receipt.
  # Exact match, not case-insensitive: the invoice endpoint compares byte-for-byte.
