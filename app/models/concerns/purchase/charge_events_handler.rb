  # charge the account processes, including ones unrelated to Gumroad. We ignore those instead of notifying.

  # The event types whose builders carry `stripe_connect_account_id` in extras, used to

  # endpoint can belong to the seller's own (non-Gumroad) Stripe activity — their own
  # store's refunds and disputes — so a missing chargeable there is routine and stays
  # quiet. On the platform endpoint every such event belongs to a Gumroad charge, so a
  # miss is alerted on — especially TYPE_REFUND_FAILED, where dropping the event would
  # mean a buyer was never made whole and nobody heard about it.
