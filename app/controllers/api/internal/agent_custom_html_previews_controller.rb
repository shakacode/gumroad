# Renders a visual preview of a custom-HTML change the store agent has proposed but the seller
# hasn't confirmed yet. The confirmation card for edit_user_custom_html / update_user_custom_html
# proposals otherwise shows only the raw find/replace markup — which sellers read as the agent
# glitching rather than as a staged page edit. This endpoint computes the page as it WOULD look
# after the change — the same sandboxed document the live /landing/embed endpoint serves — so the
# card can render a real preview inside an opaque-origin iframe.
#
# The computed document is staged in Redis and served back by URL (GET #show) rather than
# returned inline for the card to render via iframe srcdoc: srcdoc documents inherit the
# dashboard's CSP, whose script-src has no 'unsafe-inline', so every inline script in the
# previewed page — including the seller's own scripts and our sandbox shim — would be silently
# blocked. A page that renders itself client-side (say, a product grid built from the injected
# gumroad-data JSON) would preview as broken while being perfectly correct. Only a real network
# response can carry the custom-page CSP header that allows those scripts, exactly like the live
# embed endpoint does.
#
# Nothing is written here: the edit is spliced into an in-memory copy of the current page under
# the same exactly-once find-match rule the real edit endpoint enforces
# (Api::V2::UsersController#edit_custom_html), and the result runs through the same
# Ai::PageSanitizer before rendering — so what the preview shows is what confirming would publish.
